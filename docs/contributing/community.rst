Community
=========

Deis is a fully open source project. As such, the "Deis community" consists
of anyone who uses the Deis software and participates in its evolution,
whether by answering questions, finding bugs, suggesting enhancements, or
writing documentation or code.

Deis development is coordinated through its project `on GitHub`_. Anyone can
check out the source code for Deis, fork the project, make improvements,
and create a pull request to incorporate those changes into Deis.

`OpDemand`_ maintains the Deis project, and as such decides what
ends up in the official GitHub repository for Deis. Deis depends on the
contributions of the community; the maintainers will not ignore pull
requests or issues.

Deis uses the timeless, highly efficient, and totally unfair system known as
"Benevolent Dictator for Life" (`BDFL`_). `Gabriel Monroy`_, the creator of
Deis, is our BDFL and has final say over all decisions related to Deis.
