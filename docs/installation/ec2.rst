Amazon EC2 Installation
=======================

.. include:: steps1-2.txt

3. Provision a Deis Controller
------------------------------

The `Amazon EC2 API Tools`_ are used by the provisioning script to create an
EC2 Security Group and Keypair. Please install them and ensure they are
available in your $PATH:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ec2-describe-regions  # List regions to see if EC2 tools work
    REGION  eu-west-1   ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com
    REGION  sa-east-1   ec2.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com
    ...

The `knife`_ EC2 plugin is used to bootstrap the controller. It should
have been installed by ``bundle install``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ knife ec2 flavor list  # List instance types to see if knife-ec2 works
    ID                                       Name
    c1.medium                                High-CPU Medium
    c1.xlarge                                High-CPU Extra Large
    ...

Run the EC2 provisioning script, which takes several minutes to complete:

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./contrib/ec2/provision-ec2-controller.sh us-west-2
    Creating security group: deis-controller
    + ec2-create-group deis-controller -d 'Created by Deis'
    GROUP   sg-fe82aaaa deis-controller Created by Deis
    + set +x
    Authorizing TCP ports 22,80,443,514 from 0.0.0.0/0...
    + ec2-authorize deis-controller -P tcp -p 22 -s 0.0.0.0/0
    + ec2-authorize deis-controller -P tcp -p 80 -s 0.0.0.0/0
    ...

    Run List: recipe[deis::controller]
    + set +x
    Please ensure that "deis-controller" is added to the Chef "admins" group.

5. Register With the Controller
-------------------------------

Registration will discover SSH keys automatically and use the
`standard environment variables`_ **AWS_ACCESS_KEY** and **AWS_SECRET_KEY** to
configure the EC2 provider with your credentials.

.. code-block:: console

    $ sudo pip install deis
    $ deis register http://deis.example.com
    username: myuser
    password:
    password (confirm):
    email: myuser@example.com
    Registered myuser
    Logged in as myuser

    Found the following SSH public keys:
    1) id_rsa.pub
    Which would you like to use with Deis? 1
    Uploading /Users/myuser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to Deis... done

    Found EC2 credentials: AKIAJTVXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    Import these credentials? (y/n) : y
    Uploading EC2 credentials... done

6. Deploy a Formation and App
-----------------------------

Create a formation and scale it:

.. code-block:: console

    $ deis formations:create dev --flavor=ec2-us-west-2
    $ deis nodes:scale dev runtime=1
