Buildpacks
==========

Buildpacks are bundles of detection and configuration scripts which set up containers to
run applications.

Deploy using Buildpacks
-----------------------

For convenience, there are a few buildpacks that are bundled with Deis:

 * `Java buildpack`_
 * `Ruby Buildpack`_
 * `Python Buildpack`_
 * `Nodejs Buildpack`_
 * `Play Buildpack`_
 * `PHP Buildpack`_
 * `Clojure Buildpack`_
 * `Golang Buildpack`_
 * `Scala Buildpack`_
 * `Dart Buildpack`_
 * `Perl Buildpack`_

Deis will cycle through the ``bin/detect`` scripts of each buildpack to match the code you
are pushing.

Adding Custom Buildpacks
------------------------

To add a specific buildpack to your custom Deis cluster, you will need to make the change
in the `builder recipe`_ for the `Deis cookbook`_.

.. note::

    Not all Heroku buildpacks work with Deis due to environmental differences (e.g.
    missing libraries, Heroku-specific environment changes). Test any buildpack before
    using it in production deployments.

Deploying an App with a Custom Buildpack
----------------------------------------

If you want your application to use a specific buildpack that is not included in the list,
you can set the BUILDPACK_URL environment variable for your application before your first
push. For example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ deis config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/bacongobbler/heroku-buildpack-jekyll
    === classy-hardtack
    BUILDPACK_URL: https://github.com/bacongobbler/heroku-buildpack-jekyll

.. note::

    Setting config variables before your first deployment results in an error. See `issue
    542`_ for more details.
