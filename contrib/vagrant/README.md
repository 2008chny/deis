Local development workflow for Deis
================================================================

This document suggests some ways that might make developing Deis easier and cheaper. You don't have to follow
them all.

1. You'll need VirtualBox >= `4.2.18`. We recommend installing Vagrant with their binary installer from http://downloads.vagrantup.com
Vagrant 1.3.5 has support for VirtualBox 4.3

2. Firstly you need to decide whether to use your own Chef Server or the free tier of the hosted enterprise
service from Opscode. The free tier has a limit of 5 nodes which is more then enough for development. Also
bear in mind that a local Chef Server VM will take up at least 1GB of RAM.

    **Local Chef Server**
    * `cd [DEIS_DIR] && ln -s contrib/vagrant/knife-config .chef`
    * `vagrant up` the chef server Vagrantfile.
    * copy the admin.pem and validation.pem files for your own knife client
    `scp -r root@chefserver.local:/etc/chef-server/admin.pem [DEIS_DIR]/contrib/vagrant/knife-config/`
    `scp -r root@chefserver.local:/etc/chef-server/chef-validator.pem [DEIS_DIR]/contrib/vagrant/knife-config/`

    **Hosted Chef Server**
    * Goto https://getchef.opscode.com/signup and fill in your details.
    * Goto https://preview.opscode.com/login and sign in to your Chef Server.
    * Click on the 'Administration' tab and choose your organisation. There should be a tab in the sidebar that says
    'Starter Kit'. Click it and it will start a small download.
    * Inside the Starter Kit there is a '.chef' folder. Copy it to the root of your Deis codebase.
    * **NB**: You can also manage your Chef Server through https://manage.opscode.com This is the old
    interface and has more features, like being able to add clients to permission groups.

3. Now you can follow the standard deis setup:
  ```bash
  bundle install # Installs gem files like the knife tool
  berks install # Downloads the relevant cookbooks
  # '--ssl-verify' is only needed when using a local Chef Server
  berks upload [--ssl-verify=false] # Upload the cookbooks to the Chef Server
  ```

4. The Controller needs to be able to run Vagrant commands on your host machine. It does this via SSH. Therefore
you will need a running SSH server open on port 22 and a means to broadcast your hostname to local DNS.
    * On Debian-flavoured Linux you just need to;
    `sudo apt-get install openssh-server`
    * On Mac OSX you just need to go to **System Preferences -> Sharing** and enable 'Remote Login'.
    * [Mac OSX user's should already be broadcasting their hostname](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3473).
    * Linux user's will need to install avahi-daemon, so that their machine is accessible via
    [hostname].local. Eg; `sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon`.

5. Use the provision script to boot the Deis Controller.
    * If you don't already have the deis-node Vagrant box installed (~1GB). This step might take a long time! If for some reason
    you want to manually add it, use:
    `vagrant box add deis-node https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/opdemand/deis-node.box`
    * `cd contrib/vagrant && ./provision-controller.sh`
    * You will be asked to add the Controller's SSH key to your local SSH server. This will allow the Controller
    to run vagrant commands on your machine to bootstrap new nodes.
    * You need to tell the Chef Server that your new Controller has permission to create
    and delete nodes. Use:
      * For a local Chef Server just type `knife client edit deis-controller` and your default text
      editor will launch, you need to set 'admin' to 'true'.
      * For Hosted Chef you need to log into https://manage.opscode.com/ Then goto the Groups tab,
      click the 'edit' link on the 'admins' row and then under the 'clients' heading toggle the
      'deis-controller' radio button to be enabled. Then confirm the change by saving the group.

6. If you want to hack on the actual codebase, you can mount your local codebase onto the VM
   by using the custom Vagrantfile.local.
   * `cp Vagrantfile.local.example Vagrantfile.local` (don't worry it's in .gitignore)
   * Update the VM with `vagrant reload --provision`
   * When mounted you can use your favourite editor to change the code _on your local machine's path_ and then run
   `service deis-server restart` and/or `service deis-worker restart` on the VM for your changes to instantly take effect.
   * It's worth having a read of `Vagrantfile.local.example`

7. If you want to hack on the command line client (`client/deis.py`), install your local dev version rather than
the one from Pip.
    * `cd deis && make install` This installs the client into your executables path.
    * `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/deis && sudo ln ./deis.py /usr/local/bin/deis` This will symlink the dev version to your executables path.
    * Your deis controller is available at http://deis-controller.local so you can register with;
    `deis register http://deis-controller.local`

8. Right, time to boot up some nodes!
  * Create a foramtion with a vagrant flavour, 512MB, 1024MB and 2048MB are available.
  `deis formations:create dev --flavor=vagrant-512 --domain=deisapp.local`
  * Scale a node with `deis nodes:scale dev runtime=1` Be patient, this is the command that runs vagrant commands. Scaling a single node
  can take about 5 mins.
  * Then create and push your app as per the usual documentation.

## Useful development commands
* To use Django's manage.py:
  * SSH in to the VM with `vagrant ssh`
  * Switch user to deis with `sudo su deis`
  * `cd /opt/deis/controller` and activate Venv with `. venv/bin/activate`
  * Get a list of commands with; `./manage.py help`.

* To reset the DB:
  * There is a script at `contrib/vagrant/util/reset-db.sh` that resets the DB and installs some basic fixtures.
  * It installs a formation named 'dev' and a super user with username 'dev' and password 'dev'.

* This is useful for uploading your own local version of the cookbooks, rather than the Github versions:
  * `knife cookbook upload deis --cookbook-path [deis-cookbook path] --force`
  * You need to change directory structure though as knife gets the cookbook name from the folder name. So, for example I use;

  ```bash
  deis
    |__ code
      |__ api
      |__ bin
      |__ client
      |__ cm
      |__ ... and so on
    |__ cookbooks
      |__ deis
        |__ attributes
        |__ definitions
        |__ recipes
        |__ ... and so on
  ```

Notes
-----

Mac OS X: if you see an error such as
'failed to open /dev/vboxnetctl', try restarting VirtualBox:
sudo /Library/StartupItems/VirtualBox/VirtualBox restart
